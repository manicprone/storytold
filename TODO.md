# Storytold Planning


## Upcoming Features

* Add functionality to add/remove/order Chapters within a Story.

<br />

## Backlog

* Rename data schema to use singular table names throughout.

* Also, rename:
  - "users" => "user_account"
  - "user_info" => "user_ext_info"
  - "roles" => "user_role"

* Reconsider the name "persona". Perhaps => "identity" or just "profile" ???
  If "profile", then just refer to "user_ext_info" as "UserExtInfo" (as the model) ???
